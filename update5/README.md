These are the scripts used to prepare update 5.

Prerequisites:
1. gnuplot and python3
2. evmone with evm384-v7 and tracing: https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/tree/evm384-v7
3. evmcurves generated bytecode from https://gist.github.com/poemm/9c19c7146150dc66b9f1b2c8ed87c207

To generate the new figures, run `gnuplot figure1.plt` which generates `figure1.png`. Likewise for the other figures.

### evmone

To generate the tracing with evmone, the following command can be used:
```
evmc/bin/evmc run --vm ./lib/libevmone.dylib,O=0,trace `cat final_exponentiation_v3.hex`
```
(This assumes to be run in the build directory of the evm384-v7 branch.)

### opcode counts

To generate opcode counts, one could dissect the generated trace and update the counts in `figure1.plt` and `figure2.plt`.

It is possible to use `evmone` to collect counts:
```
./evmc run --vm libevmone.dylib,O=0,trace `cat final_exponentiation_v3.hex` | grep -E "[A-Z0-9][A-Z9-9][A-Z0-9]+" | sort -nr | uniq -c | sort -r
```

### gas costs

To generate the new gas costs, one can update the opcode counts in `gascosts_calculator.py`, run it, and manually update `figure3.plt` and `figure4.plt` with the outputs.
